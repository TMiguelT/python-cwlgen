Kill me if you dare
Hold my head up everywhere
Keep myself riding down this train
I'm the underdog
Live my life like a lullaby
I keep myself riding on this train
I keep myself riding on this train
Love in technicolor, sprayed out on walls
Well I've been pounding at the pavement
'Til there's nothing at all
I got my cloak and dagger
In a bar room brawl
See the local loves a fighter
Loves a winner to fall
Feels like I'm lost in a moment
But I'm always losing to win
And I can't get away from the moment
Seems like it's time to begin
Kill me if you dare
Hold my head up everywhere
Keep myself riding on this train
I'm the underdog
Live my life on a lullaby
I keep myself riding on this train
I keep myself riding on this train
It don't matter
I won't do what you say
No money and no power
I won't go your way
I can't take for the people
They don't matter at all
Well I've been waiting in the fuckin' shadows
'Til the day that you fall
It feels like I'm lost in a moment
But I'm always losing to win
Can't get away from the moment
Seems like it's time to begin
Kill me if you dare
Hold my head up everywhere
Keep myself riding on this train
But I'm the underdog
Live my life on a lullaby
I keep myself riding on this train
So tell me if you're down
Throw your weapons to the ground
I keep myself riding on this train
Paper on the wire
Sold your soul for another one
I keep myself riding on this train
(Okay Leicester)
I keep myself riding on this train
